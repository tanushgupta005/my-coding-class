# 1) Ask the user to enter a number and store it in `n`.
n=int(input("enter a number_"))
# 2) Set `sum` to 0.
sum=0
# (This will store the running total.)

# 3) Use a `for` loop from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum=sum+i

print(sum)
# - In each step, add the current value of `i` to `sum`.
# 4) After adding, print the current value of `sum`.

# (So the user can see how the sum increases step by step.)
